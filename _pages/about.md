<!-- **I'm actively recruiting lab members**, so please send me your CV and a brief
description of your research interests if you'd like to be considered! -->

I'm an PhD candidate supervised by Professor [Jun Liu](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/jun-liu(828ed819-1d73-466a-b468-63b5292cb4f6).html) and also working with Prof. [Yixuan Yuan](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/), Prof. [Jianqin Yin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jianqin-Yin) and Prof. [Zhuoran Zhang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/zhangzhuoran) in the
[City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/)â€™s
[Centre for Robotics and Automation](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/cra/).
I am also affiliated with the 
[Multiscale Automation and Robotics Laboratory (MARS Lab)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/mne/marslab/).
Previously, I received my B.Eng. in
[Mechanical Engineering](http://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/) working with Professor
[Zhenping Wan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhenping-Wan) at the
[South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).

My Research interests lie in the interdisciplinary field of medical image analysis, computer vision, and deep learning.
My goal is to develop innovative and intelligent systems that can facilitate highly efficient and superior-quality medical diagnoses and interventions. 
Recently, my focus has been on analysing small medical objects to aid in the early diagnosis of diseases.
I am also intrigued by label-efficient deep learning solutions, such as data augmentation in self-supervised learning and domain adaptation, to create reliable and effective intelligent systems.
